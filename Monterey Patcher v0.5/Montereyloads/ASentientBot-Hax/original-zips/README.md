This directory contains Hax (compiled for Catalina), HaxYosemite (same as Hax, but recompiled against Yosemite), Hax2, and Hax3, all as originally packaged and uploaded to the MacRumors Forums by their developer, ASentientBot.

The "really simple installer hack.zip" (Hax1), Hax2.zip, and
"i really need to come up with a less silly name for this.zip" (Hax3)
archives all contain source code.
